## Assets
This folder contains the assets to be used in **3D Modeler**. Each shader comes as a .vert and .frag file. Note that both must be loaded into the modeler for the shader to work correctly.

The two images (`Earth_Normal_Map.jpg` and `Earth_Color_Texture.jpg`) are used for by the normal map shader to create the illusion of texture without altering the object's geometry.
